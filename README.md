# LAMBDA EXPRESSION

A lambda expression in Java is a concise way to define and use small blocks of code, often for tasks that can be treated as data. It's a feature introduced in Java 8 that makes code more readable and expressive, especially when working with functional interfaces (interfaces with a single method). Lambda expressions allow you to write code in a more declarative and functional style, making it easier to work with collections, perform actions on elements, and perform various other operations. They consist of parameters, an arrow operator (->), and an expression or block of code. Lambda expressions are particularly useful when passing behavior as arguments to methods or when dealing with functional programming concepts.

```(parameters) -> expression or block of code```
